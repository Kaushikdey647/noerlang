# NOERLANG
## idk about erlang but this one cannot throw errors lol

## Key Components
- **Lexer**:
    - `bas.l`: The flex file that defines the tokens and the rules for the lexer.
    - `lex.yy.c`: The C file generated by flex that contains the lexer.
- **Parser**:
    - `bas.y`: The bison file that defines the grammar and the rules for the parser.
    - `y.tab.c`: The C file generated by bison that contains the parser.
    - `y.tab.h`: The header file generated by bison that contains the tokens.

## How to generate

- **Lexer**:
    - `flex bas.l`
- **Parser**:
    - `bison -v bas.y`
    - `yacc -v -d bas.y`
